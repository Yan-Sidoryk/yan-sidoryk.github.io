        The Minsk branch of the State Bank, which was opened in 1881, was first located in an adapted room. In the early 20th century the building for the State Bank was specially erected on the Podgornaya street. It was a monumental two-story building with a basement. On the first floor there were numerous office services, on the second floor there was an operating room, in the basement utility rooms and cash storerooms were located. The branch of the state Bank of Russia occupied a privileged position among the debt institutions of the city, as it was associated with the state budget. Its commercial activity was concentrated mainly around the timber trade. In 1899, the Minsk branch ranked fifth in Russia in terms of the number of promissory notes taken into account, ahead of all other branches of Belarus and Lithuania.
The same building housed the Minsk branch of the joint stock company «Russian North-Western shipping company» (the Board was located in Libava). The Department issued tickets to passengers traveling to America, Africa, Canada, England.
 After the October revolution, it housed the Central Committee of the C.P.(B.)U. And the Central Committee of the All Union Leninist Young Communist League and Komsomol, the people's Commissariat of Finance of the BSSR, the editors of the magazine «Belarusian female worker and rural woman». Since 1933 there was an Executive Committee of the City Council, since 1944 - the City Committee and the regional Committee of C.P.(B.)U., the Executive Committee of the City Council, since 1967 - the State Museum of the BSSR. The building is preserved in a restored form. Now in this building there is the National Museum of history and culture of Belarus (K. Marx Street, 14).
