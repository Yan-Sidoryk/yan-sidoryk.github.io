        The Governor's garden, or Park, was founded in 1800 on the initiative of the Minsk Governor Zakhar Korneev for the rest of the city's residents. Then it occupied 18 hectares and was almost the largest park in Belarus. It had healing springs, well-maintained alleys, a boat station worked in summer, and an ice rink worked in winter.
At the end of the XIX-XX centuries there was a bike lane in the park - the first sports facility in the city, where competitions and exhibitions were held. There was a Summer theater in the Park. At the end of 1891 in one of the rooms at the summer theater Maas, the architect of the provincial administration created an art and carpentry studio, where he not only taught free of charge, but also gave students 50 kopecks weekly from his funds to enable them to attend classes. With the beginning of the theater season, the studio was closed. [10, p. 193]
 In the early 1900s, a circus moved to Governor's Park. Its building was in the place where a monument to M. Gorky is now located .
In 1892 the city society of sport enthusiasts which was organized by Karol Czapskiy. There were only 134 permanent members, who paid quite high fees of about 6-7 roubles annually. There planned to be a whole complex of sports facilities where people could practice gymnastics, fencing, swimming, horse riding, cycling, skating. Not all the plans were realized, nevertheless, the first stadium, however, small, was built with the racetrack, with platforms for lawn tennis, bowling alley, croquet, with gymnastic equipment and games for children. [14, p. 200]
 It was located in the City Garden not far from the place where a sports complex is situated nowadays on Pervomayskaya street.
